AppWizard has created this fn45254_prob3_vc application for you.

make up your fn45254_prob3_vc application.


fn45254_prob3_vc.vcxproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

fn45254_prob3_vc.vcxproj.filters
    This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the association between the files in your project 
    and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with

    "Source Files" filter).
